onUserInteraction()是Activity的回调。

/**
 * Called whenever a key, touch, or trackball event is dispatched to the
 * activity.  Implement this method if you wish to know that the user has
 * interacted with the device in some way while your activity is running.
 * This callback and {@link #onUserLeaveHint} are intended to help
 * activities manage status bar notifications intelligently; specifically,
 * for helping activities determine the proper time to cancel a notification.
 * <p>All calls to your activity's {@link #onUserLeaveHint} callback will
 * be accompanied by calls to {@link #onUserInteraction}.  This
 * ensures that your activity will be told of revelant user activity such
 * as pulling down the notification pane and touching an item there.
 *
 * <p>Note that this callback will be invoked for the touch down action
 * that begins a touch gesture, but may not be invoked for the touch-moved
 * and touch-up actions that follow.
 *
 * @see #onUserLeaveHint()
 */
public void onUserInteraction() {
}


onUserInteraction()和onUserLeaveHint()都是用来判断notification是否需要被cancel的。
onUserInteraction()调用会在onUserLeaveHint()之前。
onUserInteraction()会在touch down被调用，但touch move和touch up不会调用。
与onUserLeaveHint()不同，back键会回调2次。
