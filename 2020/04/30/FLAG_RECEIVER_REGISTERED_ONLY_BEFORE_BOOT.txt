FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY_BEFORE_BOOT是Intent.java的静态常量

/**
 * If set, when sending a broadcast <i>before boot has completed</i> only
 * registered receivers will be called -- no BroadcastReceiver components
 * will be launched.  Sticky intent state will be recorded properly even
 * if no receivers wind up being called.  If {@link #FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY}
 * is specified in the broadcast intent, this flag is unnecessary.
 *
 * <p>This flag is only for use by system services as a convenience to
 * avoid having to implement a more complex mechanism around detection
 * of boot completion.
 *
 * @hide

public static final int FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY_BEFORE_BOOT = 0x04000000;

如果已经设置了FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY，那么就没有设置FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY_BEFORE_BOOT
的必要了。

设置FLAG_RECEIVER_REGISTERED_ONLY_BEFORE_BOOT后，系统启动完成之前，只有动态注册的Receiver
可以接收到广播。
