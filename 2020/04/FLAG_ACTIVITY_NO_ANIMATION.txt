FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION是Intent.java的静态常量

/**
 * If set in an Intent passed to {@link Context#startActivity Context.startActivity()},
 * this flag will prevent the system from applying an activity transition
 * animation to go to the next activity state.  This doesn't mean an
 * animation will never run -- if another activity change happens that doesn't
 * specifiy this flag before the activity started here is displayed, then
 * that transition will be used.  This flag can be put to good use
 * when you are going to do a series of activity operations but the
 * animation seen by the user shouldn't be driven by the first activity
 * change but rather a later one.
 */
public static final int FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION = 0x00010000;

FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION可以禁止Activity动画的播放。但它不是一直禁止，仅在startActivity
的Intent加入了该flag才禁止。下次startActivity时，如果未添加该flag，Activity动画就会播放。
它主要用在一些列activity切换，但仅在后面的activity播放动画时使用。
