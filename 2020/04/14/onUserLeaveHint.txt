onUserLeaveHint()是Activity的回调方法。

/**
 * Called as part of the activity lifecycle when an activity is about to go
 * into the background as the result of user choice.  For example, when the
 * user presses the Home key, {@link #onUserLeaveHint} will be called, but
 * when an incoming phone call causes the in-call Activity to be automitically
 * brought to the foreground, {@link #onUserLeaveHint} will not be called on
 * the activity being interrupted.  In cases when it is invoked, this method
 * is called right before the activity's {@link #onPause} callback.
 *
 * <p>This callback and {@link #onUserInteraction} are intended to help
 * activities manage status bar notifications intelligently; specifically,
 * for helping activities determine the proper time to cancel a notification.
 *
 * @see #onUserInteraction()
 */
protected void onUserLeaveHint() {
}

用户按Home键时，onUserLeaveHint()会在onPause()之前被调用。
用户按Back键时，onUserLeaveHint()并不会被调用。
被电话打断时，并不会调用onUserLeaveHint()。

如果是应用的话，添加FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_USER_ACTION后，被打断Activity也不会调用
onUserLeaveHint()。
