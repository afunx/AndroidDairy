FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_USER_ACTION是Intent.java的静态常量

/**
 * If set, this flag will prevent the normal {@link android.app.Activity#onUserLeaveHint}
 * callback from occuring on the current frontmost activity before it is
 * paused as the newly-started activity is brought to the front.
 *
 * <p>Typically, an activity can rely on that callback to indicate that an
 * explicit user action has caused their activity to be moved out of the
 * foreground. The callback marks an appropriate point in the activity's
 * lifesycle for it to dismiss any notifications that it intends to display
 * "until the user has seen them," such as a blinking LED.
 *
 * <p>If an activity is ever started via any non-user-driven events such as
 * phone-call receipt or an alarm handler, this flag should be passed to {@link
 * Context#startActivity Context.startActivity}, ensuring that the pausing
 * activity does not think the user has acknowledged its notification.

如果设置了这个标志，可以避免用户离开当前Activity时回调onUserLeaveHint()。
通常，Activity可以通过这个回调表明有明确的用户行为将当前Activity切出前台。
onUserLeaveHint()回调可以确认用户已经看到了通知。

如果一个Activity并非用户驱动的事件，如打电话或者闹钟，这个标志位应该被设置
在startActivity里，确保暂停Activity时，并不认为用户已经知道了通知。
