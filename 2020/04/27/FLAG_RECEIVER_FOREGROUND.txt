FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND是Intent.java的静态常量

/**
 * If set, when sending a broadcast the recipient is allowed to run at
 * foreground priority, with a shorted timeout interval.  During normal
 * broadcasts the receivers are not automatically hoisted out of the
 * background priority class.
 */
public static final int FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND = 0x10000000;

FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND可以让接收者以前台优先级运行，有更短的时间间隔。
正常的广播接收者只是后台优先级，并且不会被自动提升。
