android:documentLaunchMode是Activity的属性。可以设置为4个值:
none, never, always, intoExisting。默认为none。

<activity android:name=".XxxActivity"
	android:documentLaunchMode="none|never|always|intoExisting"
	/>

Value			Description
"intoExisting"	The system searches for a task whose base intent's ComponentName and data URI match those of
				the launching intent. If the system finds such a task, the system clears the task, and restarts with the
				root activity receiving a call to onNewIntent(android.content.Intent). If the system does not
				find such a task, the system creates a new task.

"always"		The activity create a new task for the document, even if the document is already opened. This is the
				same as setting both the FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT and FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK
				flags.

"none"			The activity does not create a new task for the activity. This is the default value, which creates a new
				task only when FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK is set. The overview screen treats the activity as it would
				by default: it displays a single task for the app, which resumes from whatever activity the user last
				invoked.

"never"			The activity is not launched into a new document even if the Intent contains
				FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT. Setting this overrides the behavior of the
				FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DUOCUMENT and FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK flags, if either of these
				are set in the activity, and the overview screen displays a single task for the app, which resumes from
				whatever activity the user last invoked.


!!! Note: For values other than "none" and "never" the activity must be defined with launchMode="standard". If
	this attribute is not specified, documentLaunchMode="none" is used.

"intoExisting"
		The activity reuses an existing task for the document. This is the same as setting the
		FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT flag without setting the FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTILE_TASK flag, as described in
		Using the Intent flag to add a task, above.

"always"
		The activity creates a new task for the document, even if the document is already opened. Using this value is the
		same as setting both the FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT and FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK flags.

"none"
		The activity does not create a new task for the document. The Recents screen treats the activity as it would by
		default: it displays a single task for the app, which resumes from whatever activity the user last invoked.

"never"
		The activity does not create a new task for the document. Setting this value override the behavior of the
		FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT and FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK flags, if either of these are set in the intent,
		and the Recents screen displays a single task for the app, which resumes from whatever activity the user last
		invoked.


!!! Note: For values other than none and never the activity must be defined with launchMode="standard". If this attribute is
	not specified, documentLaunchMode="none" is used.


document是android 5.0之后引入的机制。Activity处于不同document，可以显示在不同的Recents里。

"intoExisting"	等同于flags设置了FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT，但未设置FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK。

"always"		等同于flags同时设置了FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT和FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK。

"none"			默认使用

"never"			效果与"none"类似。除此之外，它会覆盖flags设置的FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT和FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK。

注意：			除了"none"和"never"之外，其他的需要launchMode="standard"才会生效。否则，就会被设置为默认的"none"。
