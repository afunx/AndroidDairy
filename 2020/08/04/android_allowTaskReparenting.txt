android:allowTaskReparenting是一个标签，可以用在Application和Activity中。

在Application中,

<application android:allowTaskReparenting=["true" | "false"]
</application>

Whether or not activities that the application defines can move from the task that started them to the task
they have an affinity for when that task is next brought to the front - "true" if they can move, and "false"
if they must remain with the task where they started. The default value is "false".

The <activity> element has its own allowTaskReparenting attribute that can override the value set
here. See that attribute for more information.

以上主要解释在Application中, allowTaskReparenting默认值为false。allowTaskReparenting表示是否允许activity移动
到所属的affinity的task中。
上述描述过于书面化。举个简单例子，就可以理解了。比如，应用A打开了应用B的ActivityC。按下Home键回到桌面。打开
应用B，看到的并不是应用B的首页，而是ActivityC。应用A中的ActivityC被移动到了应用B中。当然, allowTaskReparenting
被设置成了true。
<activity>也可以重新定义自己的allowTaskReparenting值。

在Activity中,

<activity android:allowTaskReparenting=["true" | "false"]
</activity>

Whether or not the activity can move from the task that started it to the task it has an affinity for when that
task is next brought to the front - "true" if it can move, and "false" if it must remain with the task where it
started.

If this attribute is not set, the value set by the corresponding allowTaskReparenting attribute of the
<application> element applies to the activity. The default value is "false".

Normally when an activity is started, it's associated with the task of the activity that started it and it stays
there for its entire lifetime. You can use this attribute to force it to be re-parented to the task it has an affinity
for when its current task is no longer is displayed. Typically, it's used to cause the activities of an application to
move to the main task associated with that application.

For example, if an e-mail message contains a link to a web page, clicking the link brings up an activity that
can display the page. That activity is defined by the broser application, but is launched as part of the e-mail
task. If it's reparented to the browser task, it will be shown when the browser next comes to the front, and will
be absent when the e-mail task again comes forward.

The affinity of an activity is defined by the taskAffinity attribute. The affinity of a task is determined by
reading the affinity of its root activity. Therefore, by definition, a root activity is always in a task with the same
affinity. Since activities with "singleTask" or "singleInstance" launch modes can only be at the root of a
task, re-parenting is limited to the "standard" and "singleTop" modes. (See alwo the launchMode attribute.)

以上主要解释了allowTaskReparenting的作用，请参考Application中的解释，不再累述。每个activity的taskAffinity由
启动它们的root activity的taskAffinity决定。只有"standard"和"singleTop“的launchMode支持allowTakkReparenting。
因为"singleTop"和"singleInstance"中的activity，始终都是root activity。
