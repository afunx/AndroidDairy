android:process是一个标签，可以用字在Activity，Application，Provider和Service中。

在Activity中，

<activity android:process="string"
</activity>

The name of the process in which the activity should run. Normally, all components of an application run in a
default process name created for the application and you do not need to use this attribute. But if necessary,
you can override the default process name with this attribute, allowing you to spread your app components
across multiple processes.

If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new process, private to the application, is
created when it's needed and the activity runs in that process. If the process name begins with a lowercase
character, the activity will run in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so. This
allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing resource usage.

The <application> element's process attribute can set a different default process name for all
components.

以上内容如果直接按照英文翻译，会让人非常不解。经过实践后，得出这样的结论:
定义str为字符串，包含大小写字母、数字、'.'(注意:不包含':')。其中，数字不能放在首位。

1. 如果process以':'+str形式，那么最终进程为applicationId + ':' + str。':'只能放在首位，
以此确保了':'+str为application私有进程。
2. 如果process以str形式，str中必须包含至少一个'.'，且允许出现在首位。此时，该进程属于
全局共有的，权限允许时，其他activity也能运行在相同的进程中。

在Application中,

<application android:process="string"
</activity>

The name of a process where all components of the application should run. Each component can override
this default by setting its own process attribute.

By default, Android creates a process for an application when the first of its components needs to run. All
components then run in that process. The name of the default process matches the packages name set by the
<manifest> element.

By setting this attribute to a process name that's shared with another application, you can arrange for
components of both applications to run in the same process -- but only if the two applications also share a
user ID and be signed with the same certificate.

If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon(':'), a new process, private to the application, is
created when it's needed. If the process name begins with a lowercase character, a global process of that
name is created. A global process can be shared with other applications, reducing resource usage.

以上内容除了Activity中提到的规则外，还增加了几点application独有的:
1. application中的component默认为application的process，但也可另外设置。
2. 当application中的某个component需要运行时，android才为这个application创建一个进程并启动之。
3. 默认process为applicationId(实际测试当applicationId和manifest的packagename不同时，以applicationId为准。)
4. 多个应用可以运行在同一进程中，但需要满足以两个条件: (1) 相同的user ID (2) 相同的签名证书

在Provider中,

<provider android:process="string"
</provider>

The name of the process in which the content provider should run. Normally, all components of an application
run in the default process created for the application. It has the same name as the application package. The
<application> element's process attribute can set a different default for all components. But each
component can override the default with its own process attribute, allowing you to spread your application
across multiple processes.

If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new process, private to the application, is
created when it's needed and the activity runs in that process. If the process name begins with a lowercase
character, the activity will run in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so. This
allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing resource usage.

以上内容与Activity中提到的基本相同，不再累述。

在Service中,

<service android:process="string"
</service>

The name of the process where the service is to run. Normally, an components of an application run in the
default process created for the application. It has the same name as the application package. The
<application> element's process attribute can set a different default for all components. But component
can override the default with its own process attribute, allowing you to spread your application across
multiple processes.

If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new process, private to the application, is
created when it's needed and the service runs in that process. If the process name begins with a lowercase
character, the service will run in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so. This
allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing resource usage.

以上内容与Activity中提到的基本相同，不再累述。
